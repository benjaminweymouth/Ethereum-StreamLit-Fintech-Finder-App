## Cryptocurrency Wallet: Using StreamLit, Ganache and Python

 
This repository explores the following concepts: 

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

Once you receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.
 
## Steps & Screenshots:

Step 1: Download the source code, Install python3, streamlit, and all related dependencies. 

Step 2: Run streamlit in the terminal: type `streamlit run fintech_finder.py`. Then open the app in the localhost with port as indicated in the screenshot:

## Conclusions: 

The streamlit app was successful, and the transaction completed successfully. The amount was appropriate and is utilizing the wage formula as stipulated in the fintech_founder python file. The mnemonic phrase is correctly called, and so is the account information and the account balance.
